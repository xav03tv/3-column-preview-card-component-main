## My process

This is my first Frontent Mentor project.

I started by making the structure in HTML and then applied the desktop style. I added the mobile style afterwards.

I decided not to enlarge more than 3 cards on a big screen. Having a 4k screen, it looks good like this.

I could have added different break point to better adapt the design to each type of screen. But I'm in a hurry to do other projects :-p

(sorry for my english ... )
